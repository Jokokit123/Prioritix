            <h1>Our Company</h1>
            <p> 
				Our company "Prioritix" operates in the decision-support industry, recognizing the overwhelming fatigue that comes with option overload- <br>
				a common problem that affects the masses worldwide- yet isn't well addressed, rendering oneself cumbered and unable to make a choice, <br>
				hindering overall productivity and efficiency. Prioritix aims to develop smart decision-support tools and systems <br>
				to aid users in making grounded, well-informed and stress-free decisions. <br>
			</p> <br>
			<p> 
				The decision-support industry is becoming more and more important as people face more daily choices and become encumbered with <br>
				option overload in various aspects of life, forming and shaping our vision to empower individuals to make clear, confident decisions <br>
				in this world of endless options, to instantiate a mindset of productivity and reduce the ever-looming stress of decision fatigue. <br>
			</p> <br>
			<p> 
				And to realize that dream, we have made it our mission to create flexible, reliable and intuitive tools to simplify decision making <br>
				and comply with the people's needs by offering both structured and customizable prioritization methods, <br>
				and enhance - across personal, academic, and professional settings - user well-being, productivity, and efficiency. <br>
			</p> <br>
			<p> 
				Specializing in productivity and decision-support software, we operate in SaaS [Software as a Service] industry, with the objective <br>
				of this marketing plan being the successful launch of Prioritix's new product: the Priority Checklist Generator [PCG] <br>
			</p> <br>

			<p> 
				We empathized and - based on feedback from interviewees - brainstormed ideas. While we first thought about creating a random name picker,
				we wanted something more complex, flexible and something that helps guide the user - giving them a clear sense of priority,
				we asked ourselves many questions on how we could make it more flexible, <br>
				offer freedom of choice and open doors. And thus- we settled on a design. <br>
			</p> <br>
			<p> 
				By giving way for the user to add, remove and easily modify their categories based on their needs, and providing a couple methods of entering data at their convenience, we created:
				The Priority Checklist Generator [PCG]
				The Priority Checklist Generator is a flexible and reliable decision-support tool designed to aid users in prioritizing and organizing their 
				options and choices based on professional and personal criteria. Covering a wide range of situations and circumstances,
				from the high-risk like academic course selection and financial planning, to the low-risk like picking a game to play,
				what clothes to wear, choosing something from the restaurant menu for dinner, and most daily choices, this tool offers a streamlined,
				stress-free decision making catered to all contexts and users looking for a simplified way to make their choices and escape decision-fatigue.
			</p> <br>
			<p> Equipped with many features, the most unique and prominent can be summed up in: </p>

							<div id = "ChapterCurrentProgress" style = "width: 25%"></div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p> 
				While decision support systems exist already, we differentiate ours through it's flexibility.
				Unlike other niche-specific tools, this one accommodates a wide range of decision-making contexts
				across multiple different sectors; by combining the manual and the template-based input, it becomes
				a versatile tool unlike any other with it's capability of being implemented in any decision-making process, making it novel to the whole world.
			</p> <br>
			<p> 
				We have conducted multiple 1-on-1 interviews with four people to empathize and learn about their current situation and experience with option overload,
				and we have recorded real data of what they think, feel, hear, see, say, do, pains, and gains. Giving us a clear outlook of what our users are going
				through and making adjustments to our product accordingly.
